4 ghouls
chanting farther down
went back to the two doors
opened the one on right
opened it 
2 more doors inside
large stone coffin in the one on the right
room is 5x10
Gustav durst is the master of the house
Elizabeth durst is the mother
other door is clawed at
bugs poored out of the coffin
other side has 2 untouched doors
sealed coffin on the left side
rose heads into coffin and bids us ado
thorn lays to rest peacefully in other room
5 shadows facing the statue in the room
dark crystal orb in the statue
mist in the orb
dining room past the ghouls
vanity with brush, makeup, lockbox
old parchment in the lockbox
1 spell scroll -> disguise self
1 spell scroll -> darkvision
ghast climbs out of the wall
hole with a door
took a short rest
spikes guarding entry way
