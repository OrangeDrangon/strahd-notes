Flesh pile is going to kill us
brok is engulfed
house completely collapses as we flee
fog leaves the area of the house
barn is in much better shape
Master Kolyanovich,

I regret your loss, I truly do. But surely now you must see the futility of your efforts. I offer you a simple trade:

Release Tatyana to me, and I will see that you are left in peace. 

Your dread lord and master,
Strahd von Zarovich
