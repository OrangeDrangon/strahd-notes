top hat goes away as orb leaves contact
heading down the path
stench as we are walking
it is getting a lot stronger
paw prints around the body
find another envelope with just a seal in his hands
wolves are closing in
going back to the road scared them off
jagged buildings off in the distance
as we get closer there is a village
seems to be civilized and paved roads
village we walk into:

road forks towards buildings and two other more important buildings
left building has smoke and there is some light in the windows
bildraths mercantile
smell of herbs and spices
burgomaster is the seal
general store
there is life around the town
heavy claws on the walls
boarded up window and reinforced door
door locked and no response to knock
going into the cellar
other large building has makeshift tables with people
finally found the tavern it is musky and people seem uneasy of our prescense
scared the barkeep shitless by cleaning a glass
man to the side seems uninterested
shrieking in the burgomaster house at night until two weeks ago
man is now intently interesed in us
arik is the barkeep
young man with long blonde hair
leather vest with fur lining
he seems happy to see us
buys us a round
ismark questions our purpose
opens letter

vistani are the ones who sent us here
servants of the dark lord strahd
strahd was carrying out the attacks
strahd himself came and left his mark on her
the church is run down and the priest stays up all night
escort sister to vilaki
vilaki is a larger city far from here
book with minor illusion and chromatic orb
eye of strahd -> gives strahd an eye in places he normally would not see
burried it straight out from the burgomaster house
church of the morning lord
screaming in the church
people tried to confront strahd and are most likely dead
his son doru and several other villagers stormed castle ravenloft in revolt to strahd
they were lured to the castle some time ago
none of the villagers returned and he believes doru died as well
doru returned days after as a vampire spawn
abbey of saint markovie in krezk
fortified town of vlaki in reserve
